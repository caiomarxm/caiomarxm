### Hey there ğŸ‘‹

As a physics student I'm very curious and passionate about how the universe works, and as a programmer I'm very excited about creating new universes!

I'm currently learning SQL and NoSQL databases and a bit of C# to start working with .net frameworks, and I'm open to internship possibilities!
